Initial (official) release! 🎉

🔐 Key derivation for the DigitalBits blockchain (based on Stellar's [SEP-0005](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0005.md)) 🚀

Future versions will keep package dependencies up-to-date and refine the library's API as needed to support any changes to SEP-0005 or the underlying [bip39 npm module](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39).
